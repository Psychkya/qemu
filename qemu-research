This emulation is rpi 2 which uses a broadcom board and a cortex arm processor. Interestingly, the author says that qemu 'requires' kernel 
and is extracting it from the image

Not sure what windows 10 IoT is - need to figure that out. But it appears that -bios option is available when using qemu from a windows system (?) Looks like linux uses
-kernel. At any rate, this doc seems to indicate that the bootloader is UEFI

Perhaps we can use u-boot on top of the bootloader that comes with raspbian

Looks like -bios option needed to use u-boot

Also found some tid-bits that u-boot may not work with the main qemu repo. Need this modified repo and compile qemu for it to work.
